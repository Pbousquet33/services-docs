h1. Getting Started

Steps to getting started with a Partner Account.

# Sign up for an app cloud account at "http://cloud.engineyard.com/":http://cloud.engineyard.com/.  A Trial account is fine.
# E-mail your contact at EngineYard with the following information:
* The email you used to signup
* The name of your ey cloud account
* The name you'd like to use for your "partner" account (this is internal only)

EY will then create a parter account for you, granting you access to: "https://services.engineyard.com":https://services.engineyard.com

This page will give you the information you need to be able to register services.  Once you have registered a service, you will be able to use the web UI to activate it in "test" for the ey cloud account your created in step #1.
