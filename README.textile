h1. Getting Started

Steps to getting started with an Engine Yard partner account.

# Sign up for an Engine Yard Cloud account at "http://cloud.engineyard.com/":http://cloud.engineyard.com/.  A trial account is fine.
# Email your contact at Engine Yard with the following information:
** The email you used to sign up
** The name of your Engine Yard Cloud account
** The name you want to use for your partner account. (This is internal only.)

Engine Yard then creates a partner account for you, granting you access to: "https://services.engineyard.com":https://services.engineyard.com

This page provides you with the information you need to to register services.  After you have registered a service, you can use the web UI to activate the service in "test" for the Engine Yard Cloud account your created in Step 1.
