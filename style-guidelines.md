# Style Guide

### Two important points about Engine Yard Platform Services integration:

*  You must apply your website's look-and-feel to any application pages that users visit through the Platform Services integration. 
For example, if a user clicks the Configure button for Service "Y" on the Engine Yard active services page, the target page uses the same CSS styling as the other pages on Y's website. This way, the user recognizes that s/he has moved from Engine Yard to Y. 

*  At the end of any workflow on your website, you must use a return-to-Engine-Yard button to send users back to their Engine Yard Cloud account.
